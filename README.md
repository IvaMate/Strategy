# Strategy
This is a 2d strategy game, made in Gamemaker studio 2. It has 30 day free version so this is as much as I can share. Anybody who has this studio can try to play the game and see the code.
In this simple game I made sprites which can cut trees and build houses. Also in the left corner is information about how much trees we have to build houses.
All sprites are animated.
